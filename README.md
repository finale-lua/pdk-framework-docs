# Finale-Lua PDK Framework Documentation

This repository automatically publishes its `current_production_version` branch to the website [pdk.finalelua.com](https://pdk.finalelua.com).
The html pages are generated automatically from C++ source code by Doxygen. If you would like to suggest changes, do not issue pull requests. Instead create an Issue on this repository and it can be incorporated in the next release of the PDK Framework documentation.
